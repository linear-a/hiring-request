# MUSC Hiring Requests

MUSC is looking to understand what drives hiring, and see if they can get 
out in front of the hiring requests. This repo is looking to answer a couple questions

Goal #1

Can we predict which departments will request headcount, and when? 
This will be a classification model that looks for inputs that correlate with hiring requests.
We can lag the target variable say 30/60/90 days out, in an effort to give our predictions
more time to develop. 

Goal #2

Find what features matter most for requesting headcount? Is it just a matter of capacity?
How much does the inflow of patients matter? How quickly do they request after certain
thresholds? This is the area where we would like to be more clear to MUSC - we may be able 
to generate this knowledge from Goal #1, but this is where we clear up our story
